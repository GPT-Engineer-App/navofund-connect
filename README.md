# navofund-connect

so me and my group partner are looking to build a webapp design for a company named Navomark, the company is based on having project owners from different various feilds like agriculture, construction and others can inlist their projects within the webapp and also we want to have funders too so that they can be the ones who are fundinding in the inlisted projects from project owners 

this is basically a middle man app the takes 3% of any fund transaction that happens on our webapp so there should also be a chat box that allows scheduled meeting between funders and project owners to conversate and share documentation 

funders should also be able to make transactions to project owners through our platform and tat how we will be taking our 3% commision
